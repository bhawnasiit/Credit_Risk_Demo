## 🚀 Quick Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/bhawnasharma/Documents/Interview_2025/Credit_Risk_Demo

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git branch -M main

# Add all files
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Credit Risk PD Model Demo

Features:
- Complete ML pipeline from data to deployment
- Advanced calibration (Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression)
- Threshold optimization for business objectives
- Interactive Streamlit app
- Comprehensive EDA and validation
- Multiple model comparison
- Well-documented with examples and visualizations"

# Create a new repository on GitHub.com, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Credit_Risk_Demo.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 📝 Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **https://github.com/new**
2. **Repository name**: `Credit_Risk_Demo` or `credit-risk-pd-model`
3. **Description**: 
   ```
   Comprehensive credit risk PD model with advanced calibration, threshold optimization, and interactive Streamlit app
   ```
4. **Public** or **Private**: Your choice (Public for portfolio)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have them)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## 🏷️ Repository Settings

After creating the repository on GitHub:

### Add Topics/Tags
Click "Add topics" and add:
- `credit-risk`
- `machine-learning`
- `python`
- `streamlit`
- `scikit-learn`
- `model-calibration`
- `probability-of-default`
- `financial-modeling`
- `data-science`
- `risk-assessment`

### About Section
Use this description:
```
A production-ready credit risk Probability of Default (PD) model featuring complete ML pipeline, advanced calibration techniques, threshold optimization, and interactive Streamlit app for real-time scoring.
```
